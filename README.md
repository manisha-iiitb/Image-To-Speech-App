## Details:
This project is an image to speech android application designed for the Hindi Language. The
aim of this project is to increase user productivity by eliminating the time spent looking for
documents or business cards to read them. The application is like a scanner plus screen aloud
in a userâ€™s pocket that allows the user to scan any document or label and speaks it for the user
instantly without any hassle.
The application recognizes texts in document images and extracts them from the image and
sends the text to TTS for speaking the text aloud to the user. This application comes very
handily in this digital world.

## Tools and Technologies:
